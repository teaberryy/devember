# Devember Projects Repo

Main repo to host all barely functional programs created for [Devember](https://devember.org/)

### Why I'm doing this

I've been wanting to learn more than the basics for some time now, this is a neat way to do it. That and having a commit for every day of December will look good to any future employer (as long as they don't try and read the code :P)

### The Contract

I, teaberryy, will participate to the next Devember. My Devember will be advancing my knowledge of programming and having fun in general. I promise I will program for my Devember for at least an hour, every day of the next December. I will also write a daily public devlog and will make the produced code publicly available on the internet. No matter what, I will keep my promise. 

The plan:
  - make things that are actually useful
  - try and learn a broad variety of subjects (algorithms, audio, crypto, networking, AI)
  - improve code quality allong the way
  - move fast, break things
  - finish a project before starting another
