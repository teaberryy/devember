Note:

  All files for the respective days of AoC can be found in their directories,
  I also gave them a (needlessly redundant) name that follows the convention of `d[day]p[part].[extension]`
  So the second part of day 13's challenge would be `d13p2.sh`, for example
  
Comments assume that the day's challenge has been read on the AoC website
